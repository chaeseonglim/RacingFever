Version 1.0.1
=============
- This is primarily a bug fix release.

 - Clean up resources at exit in Swappy Vulkan on the SwappyFallback code path.

   swapchain.

Version 1.0.2
=============
This release includes bug fixes and changes in the behaviour of auto-mode.
- Bug fixes for swappy destruction and re-initialization.
- Pipelining is now *on* by default. If auto-pipelining is on, Swappy can still decide to switch
  it off when the workload is very low.
- When auto-mode is enabled, Swappy will decide to switch swap interval only after 15% of frames
  within a 2 second window are either faster or slower than expected.
  Note that Swappy will never swap slower than the user-specified swap interval.
